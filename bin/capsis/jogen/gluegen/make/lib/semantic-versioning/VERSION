    Fix jardiff's Tools.isAccessChange(..): Differentiate between Class, Field and Method and apply all rules of the Java Language Specification
    
    Class, Field and Methods have different binary backward compatibility rules
    as specified in the Java Language Specification, Java SE 7 Edition:
      - http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-13.html
    
    For Field 'volatile' the Java Language Specification, first edition has been used:
      - http://www.wsu.edu/UNIX_Systems/java/langspec-1.0/13.doc.html#45194
    
    For each type separate method have been created, i.e. Tools.is<Type>AccessChange().
    Each new method has the rules referenced and partially copied into the method
    for better documentation.
    
    The now deprecated method Tools.isAccessChange(..) calls Tools.isClassAccessChange(..)
    and shall be removed.
    
    Unit test ToolsTest has been expanded for each type and its rules.
